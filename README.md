This task uses the GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) model to generate images of human faces.

To use CelebA (CelebFaces Attributes Dataset) dataset for training, it is a large-scale face attributes dataset with more than 200K celebrity images. 
The image resolution of the model output should be between 28 and 112. The trained network produced 500 images, each with 9 human faces, arranged in 3 by 3.
